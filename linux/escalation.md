notes from room: \
When this command is executed, it uses the specified dynamic linker/loader (ld-linux-x86–64.so.2) to load the required shared libraries and start the /bin/bash shell. This method of invoking the linker/loader directly with a binary is a way to execute a binary by explicitly specifying the dynamic linker/loader to use for that particular binary.\
`/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86–64.so.2 /bin/bash`
